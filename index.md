Thanks for visiting and feel free to look around. 

If you would like to see some of my work then feel free by clicking [here](/gallery) or if you would like to book an appointment or consultation then get in touch by clicking [here](/contact).

### Note On Appointments

Just a friendly reminder for your appointment times. 

I run to a tight schedule in order to get all my clients in and looking fabulous.  With this in mind, please check your route to get to me as I would hate to turn anyone away if arriving late, or disappoint if I canâ€™t do full service that you have booked. Also charges will apply if I have to cancel an appointment. 

### Cancellation Policy

I require at least 24 hours' notice for cancellations or rescheduling to avoid a cancellation fee of 50% of the scheduled service cost. No-shows or same-day cancellations will be charged in full to ensure fairness to all my other clients. Thank you for respecting my policy, which helps me provide quality service to all.

Many thanks.
