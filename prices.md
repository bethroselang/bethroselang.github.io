### Note On Appointments

Just a friendly reminder for your appointment times. 

I run to a tight schedule in order to get all my clients in and looking fabulous.  With this in mind, please check your route to get to me. There are many road closures this time of year and I would hate to turn anyone away if arriving late, or disappoint if I can’t do full service that you have booked. Also charges will apply if I have to cancel an appointment. 

## Cancellation Policy

I require at least 24 hours' notice for cancellations or rescheduling to avoid a cancellation fee of 50% of the scheduled service cost. No-shows or same-day cancellations will be charged in full to ensure fairness my other clients. Thank you for respecting my policy, which helps me provide quality service to all.
