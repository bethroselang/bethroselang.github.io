## Keratin Complex Smoothing

What is an Express Blow Out and why you need this keratin smoothing treatment!

If you are experiencing unwanted frizz, or dry lifeless hair it’s about time you try a Keratin Complex Express Blow Out smoothing treatment. It’s our speediest hair smoothing treatment! You can have your stylist use it as an add-on during your color service to lock in color and smooth in just 15 minutes!

There’s this misconception that keratin treatments equal straight hair and that’s not the case! Keratin Complex believes that a good hair day starts with healthy hair and our hair treatments make hair healthier, stronger and smoother. Each keratin smoothing treatment in the Keratin Complex portfolio eliminates frizz, increases styling manageability, repairs damage, and leaves hair noticeably softer with incredible shine—instantly!

### What is an Express Blow Out® (EBO)?

EBO is the speediest hair smoothing solution in the Keratin Complex smoothing treatment lineup. This unique express smoothing service gives your hair the super-charge of keratin your hair is craving in just one hour, with results that last up to 6 weeks! It’s the go-to hair smoothing treatment for those new to keratin. 

EBO is truly a versatile treatment that can be done in just 15 minutes during your color appointment! Color locking is a great way to use the product especially when you are considering adding fashion colors to your new look to prevent fading and allows you to eliminate unwanted frizz at the same time! 

All hair types and lengths can benefit from an Express Blow Out®. Its unique formula allows for it to be added on to a color service for enhanced vibrant hair color and delivers customizable finishes—a curly client looking to define their curls and lose frizz and a client looking for smooth results! Stylists have also found EBO the perfect keratin smoothing tool for quick spot treatments, bangs or problem areas. 

### What can I expect after an #EBO keratin smoothing treatment?

You can expect beautiful frizz-free hair days! An Express Blowout cuts daily styling time and makes blow-drying faster and easier. Powered by our Signature Keratin, you’re in for stronger, healthier hair with noticeably radiant shine and luminous hair color. Preserve the treatment using a [Keratin Care Shampoo](https://keratincomplex.com/products/keratin-color-care-shampoo) & [Conditioner](https://keratincomplex.com/products/keratin-color-care-shampoo) formulated without sodium chloride to protect the longevity of your smoothing treatment.
