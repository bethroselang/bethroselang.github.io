## About Me

![me](/assets/img/about/about_me.png)

Hello!

I am a professional and reliable hair stylist with over 23 years of experience in all aspects of hair design, colouring, re-styles and generally making you look great and feel better! 

I trained at Guildford Hair College then went on to work at Regis (Guildford), Enzorosario (Godalming) and Somewhere in West Street (Farnham) and now work for myself from my own [salon](/salon) in Liphook, Hampshire.

I pride myself on being able to re-style or "vamp up" your hair in a comfortable, easy going and friendly environment (occasionally interrupted by my Cockapoo Digby wandering round to investigate!) at a non-high street price. 

If you would like to see some of my work then feel free by clicking [here](/gallery) or if you would like to book an appointment or consultation then get in touch by clicking [here](/contact).

Thanks,

Beth x
